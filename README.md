Dots on AVR


Code to drive the dot display with an AVR (probably an arduino).


blinky: just writes random crap to the dot display.  ignore the giant array at the top. actually just ignore this whole thing

planet: write pre-canned arrays to the display.

serial: reads strings from the serial port and displays them. this is what piccount.py expects to deal with

piccount: gets the picture count out of storage api, displays it on the dot display.
